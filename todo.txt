to do:

make alphabet soup able to end when all words are completed

may need to allow letter stations to bid on letters not in the list... toggleable flag?

add combinatorial auctions to compare to simultaneous auctions
 -multi-unit combinatorial auctions (e.g. red A is always the same... don't need to bid on all permunations of red A's)
 -combinatorial exchange -multiple buyers and sellers bidding on combinations
    -see http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/econcs/pubs/ice.pdf

compare to predicted (relaxed problem) optimal

------------------

bids for bucketbots should include travel time?
or
bids for bucketbots should be a rate. buckets need to figure out approx how long they'd need
the bucketbot for, and are locked in that rate until done (market again)
